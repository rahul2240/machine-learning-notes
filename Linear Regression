Linear regression

A graph is plotted in labelled example where the thing to predict is on the y axis represented as y' and feature is on the x axis represented as x'.

bias is the y intercept represented as b'

w is the slope of the line.

Equation of line becomes y' = b' + w1x1

Squared loss is the popular loss function

= (observation - prediction)^2

Mean square error is the average squared loss.

= (sigma(y-prediction)^2)/N

If a observed value is plotted far from the line then loss will be its squared value that is the loss will be very high and we draw a line to keep the loss very low.
