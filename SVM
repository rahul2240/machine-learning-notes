Support Vector Machine 

Margin: Line that maximizes distance from nearest point is called margin.

Outliers: Points that are lying at the wrong side.

Parametes: arguments passed when we create a classifier before fitting.

3 Parameters:
  - Kernel
  - C: controls trade off between the smooth decision boundary and classifying training points correctly.
  - Gamma: defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches.
  
  High Gamma takes consideration of near points.
  Low Gamma takes consideration of far points.
  
Overfitting: When division used is non uniform but a straight line or more uniform division that can used to separate the data.
 
Code:

  from sklearn.svm import SVC
  clf = SVC(kernel = 'rbf', C = 1000, gamma = 1)


Using less data to fit

  features_train = features_train[:len(features_train)/100]
