from sklearn import tree
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

parameters = min_samples_split

min_sample_split: minimum tree distribution
low value = more complex and accurate tree
more value = less complex and less accurate tree

Entropy: controls how decision tree will split the data.

entropy = sigma( p*logp )


Information gain = entropy(parent) - (weighted average)entropy(children)

Decision tree will try to maximize the information gain.
